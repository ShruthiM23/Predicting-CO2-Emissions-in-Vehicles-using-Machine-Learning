# Predicting-CO2-Emissions-in-Vehicles-using-Machine-Learning

# Problem Statement:

To build a model to predict the CO2 emissions (g/km) for vehicles from Canada based on their fuel
consumption and other describing features like Engine Size, Fuel Type Cylinders ,Gears etc.

# About the dataset:

The data has been taken from the Canadian Government's official website:
https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64#wb-auto-6

 I have taken the curated data from:

# Project Workflow:

1. The Data and the Problem<br>
2. Basic Data Exploration<br>
3.Exploratory Data Analysis - Univariate analysis and relationship with Target<br>
4. Continuing EDA with Feature Engineering<br>
5. Encoding<br>
6. Scaling<br>
7. Linear Regression - Modelling and Fine Tuning<br>
7.1 - Model 1 - SLR Model with Fuel Consumption<br>
7.2 - Model 2 - Fuel Consumption and Engine Size<br>
7.3 - Model 3 - Considering Columns using VIF<br>
7.4 - Model 4 - All Columns Except Make<br>
7.4.1 - 4a - OLS<br>
7.4.2 - 4b - Recursive Feature Elimination<br>
7.4.3 - 4c - Stochastic Gradient Descent<br>
7.4.4 - 4d - Forward Selection<br>
7.5 - Model 5 - All Columns including Make - Forward Selection<br>
8. The best model and assumptions of Linear Regression<br>
